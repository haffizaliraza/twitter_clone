# Let's Build A Twitter Clone using Ruby on Rails 7


If you have followed me for some time you might remember a series I did on Ruby on Rails titled “Let’s Build”. These guides were a “learn in public” exercise I tasked myself with that ultimately resonated with a number of folks.

This specific mini-series is going to focus on redoing an older “Let’s Build” where I took on building a Twitter clone.

Since the advent of Rails 7, the way you might approach new problems when building software has changed a great deal. I wanted to take the opportunity to create some fresh content and show you how to leverage some new features of Ruby on Rails along the way.
